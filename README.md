### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the time to visit this page!

Iâ€™m Jeroen Bouma, a Financial Risk Analyst at A.S.R., one of the largest Dutch insurance companies with over â‚¬120 billion AUM. I analyze profitability and investment risks in different risk frameworks (Solvency II and internal models), providing insights into portfolio sensitivities and their relationship with liabilities, assess the impact of month-to-month changes and contribute to the development of Python models for improved valuation and financial risk measurement.

I joined A.S.R. after working at OpenBB, an innovative open-source company transforming investment research, and PGGM, a prominent Dutch pension fund managing over â‚¬300 billion. What ties these experiences together, and reflects my own passion, is the incorporation of (advanced) Python modeling within Quantitative Finance.

I thrive in the realm where advanced financial modeling meets making sense of the financial markets. The financial world is primarily shaped by human behavior and often driven by emotions rather than rationality. As predicting the future is incredibly challenging, if not impossible, and investment approaches needing to rely on current and past observations, it opens up room for extensive discussions around assumptions, input for econometric models, and interpretation of their modelâ€™s output. This intersection captivates me the most and has been a consistent theme throughout my academic and professional journey.

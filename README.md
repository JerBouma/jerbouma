### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking the time to visit this page!

Iâ€™m Jeroen Bouma, a Quantitative Investment Strategist at a.s.r. asset management, one of the largest Dutch insurance companies with over â‚¬120 billion AUM. I am responsible for spearheading innovative initiatives within the asset management divisions by utilizing Python, particularly in portfolio analytics and optimization. Furthermore, I conduct Asset Liability Management (ALM) and Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) analyses, encompassing a spectrum of topics including hedging strategies, liquidity risk management, Solvency II optimization, and asset-only studies.

I joined a.s.r. asset management. after working at OpenBB, an innovative open-source company transforming investment research, and PGGM, a prominent Dutch pension fund managing over â‚¬300 billion. What ties these experiences together, and reflects my own passion, is the incorporation of (advanced) Python modeling within Quantitative Finance.
